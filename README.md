# Movies Recommender System

## Overview
The Movies Recommender System is a machine learning-based application that suggests movies based on user preferences. It utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Features
- Content-based filtering using movie metadata
- Collaborative filtering for user-based recommendations
- Uses **TMDB 5000 Movies** dataset
- Built with **Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn**
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy experimentation

## Dataset
The system uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**, which includes movie metadata such as:
- Movie titles
- Genres
- Cast and crew
- Overview
- Keywords
- Popularity and ratings

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movies_Recommender_System.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Movies_Recommender_System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
